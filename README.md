# ContrerasJReverseItAPI
In this challenge the user is typing in a string in post man and the code will be given an output of their reversed string.

peer reviewd by Daniel Decoito: The app and api both work really well. I like the use of models in this one. It adds a deeper element to the project as a whole. Everything works good, Kudos.
