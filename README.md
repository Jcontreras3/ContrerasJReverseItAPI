# ContrerasJReverseItAPI
In this challenge the user is typing in a string in post man and the code will be given an output of their reversed string.

First the will push F5 so that is debugs the code and makes sure the code is running, they will then get the local host url and paste it into postman so that the dated is being transferred to postman.
        Local Host                  Controller      Route
Example: https://localhost:7228/GreaterThanLessThan/greatorless

peer reviewd by Daniel Decoito: The app and api both work really well. I like the use of models in this one. It adds a deeper element to the project as a whole. Everything works good, Kudos.
